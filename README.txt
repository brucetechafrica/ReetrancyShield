REETRANCY SHIELD|BY BRUCE TECH

ReetrancySHIELD is a solidity contract developed to protect you from one of the most dangerous attacks in the crypto universe "Reentrancy"
What is a Reentrancy attack in Solidity?

 A reentrancy attack is a type of attack that can occur when a function or method is called recursively, that is, multiple times in quick succession.

 üîÑ This can happen when one function in a contract calls another function, which in turn calls the first function again.  This can happen if the second function is called by an external attacker.  If the first function is not designed to handle this scenario, the attacker can run their code multiple times, which may allow them to exploit the contract at will.  üò±

 It is often used to steal cryptocurrency, of course!  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
